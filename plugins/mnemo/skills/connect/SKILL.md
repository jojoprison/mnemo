# mn:connect — Discover Hidden Links

> **Invocation marker (both runtimes):** begin your reply with the exact line `🧠 mn:connect (mnemo) → running` — the user-visible confirmation that this skill actually loaded. Emit it once per invocation, before any other output.

## Portable paths

Resolve `<mnemo-root>` once to the absolute plugin root before reading bundled files or running bundled scripts. In Claude Code, use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; in Codex, derive it from this loaded `SKILL.md` path (skill directory → `skills/` → plugin root). Replace `<mnemo-root>` with that quoted absolute path in every command — never execute the placeholder literally and never hunt versioned cache directories.

When another mnemo skill must run, use the runtime-native path: Claude Code invokes `mn:<skill>` through its Skill tool; Codex reads `<mnemo-root>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` completely and follows it with the prepared input. For user-facing explicit syntax, render `/mn:<skill>` in Claude Code and `$mnemo:<skill>` in Codex.

Analyze a note and discover connections to other notes in the vault that aren't linked yet.

## Prerequisites & config

Obsidian must be open. Config at `~/.mnemo/config.json` — reads `vault`, `links_section`, `taxonomy`, and `taxonomy_roles`. Before any mapped-hub operation, require exactly the five semantic roles `fact`, `insight`, `source`, `session`, and `moc`; require every target to exist; and require `session → session` plus `moc → moc`. The deterministic legacy Zettelkasten fallback is allowed; any other missing/invalid map stops mapped routing and offers the runtime-native setup skill instead of guessing. Schema in `<mnemo-root>/references/config-schema.md`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Note

Accept a note name from the explicit invocation, for example `/mn:connect "Atom — LongCat-Flash-Prover"` in Claude Code or `$mnemo:connect Atom — LongCat-Flash-Prover` in Codex.

If no argument, ask: "Which note should I analyze for connections?"

### Step 2: Read the Note

```bash
python3 "<mnemo-root>/scripts/safe-read.py" read <<'JSON'
{"file":"{note_name}","vault":"{vault}"}
JSON
```

Extract:
- Key concepts, technologies, names mentioned in text
- Existing `[[wikilinks]]`
- Existing links in `{links_section}` section

### Step 3: Search for Related Notes + Backlinks (single grep + backlinks, parallel)

**Even better than parallel `obsidian search` calls: one literal filesystem scan for all concepts.** The helper treats each concept as data, not regex or shell syntax. It takes ~50ms for any number of concepts vs ~180ms per `obsidian search`.

```bash
# Run these TWO commands in parallel (single message, two Bash tool uses):
# 1. One literal scan — much faster than N separate Obsidian searches
python3 "<mnemo-root>/scripts/safe-read.py" grep-concepts <<'JSON'
{"vault":"{vault}","concepts":["{concept_1}","{concept_2}","{concept_N}"]}
JSON

# 2. Backlinks check
python3 "<mnemo-root>/scripts/safe-read.py" backlinks <<'JSON'
{"file":"{note_name}","vault":"{vault}"}
JSON
```

Collect matching note paths from the scan output. Exclude the target note itself. Backlinks output → notes already connected (exclude from suggestions).

**Why not `obsidian search` per concept:** each CLI call is ~180ms. One literal scan = ~50ms total for any N. On 7 concepts: 1.26s → 50ms (**25x faster**).

### Step 4: Generate Suggestions

Compare: notes found by search MINUS notes already linked (wikilinks + backlinks).

For each suggestion, explain WHY it's relevant (shared concept, shared tag, complementary topics).

**Tension-nodes (high value, ТРИЗ):** if a found note makes an OPPOSITE claim on the same question — that's NOT a duplicate, it's a `#contradiction` link worth surfacing. Two notes disagreeing on the same benchmark is a synthesis point, not noise.

### Step 5: Present (DO NOT auto-apply)

```
🔗 Connection suggestions for "{note_name}"

Already connected: {N} notes
New suggestions: {N}

1. [[Atom — SCOPE beats TextGrad]]
   Why: Both discuss agentic RL stability — HisPO and SCOPE solve similar problems

2. [[MOC — Agent Self-Correction]]
   Why: Note mentions trial→verify→reflect cycle, this MOC covers the same pattern
   Action: Add to MOC? (currently not listed there)

3. [[Session — ANT-14 TextGrad research]]
   Why: Both evaluate RL approaches for agent improvement

4. [[Atom — Full attention wins on this benchmark]]  ⚡ #contradiction
   Why: opposite conclusion on the same GPU-efficiency question — tension to resolve

Apply these? (y/N, or pick numbers: 1,3)
```

Links are applied **with their one-line context** (the «Why»), not as bare `[[wikilinks]]` (Luhmann: state why you linked).

### Step 6: Apply on Confirmation

If user confirms:
1. Read the target again, choose one unique stable anchor in `{links_section}`, then add new links **with a one-line context** (Luhmann — state why connected): `- [[Name]] — {why, ≤10 words}`, not a bare `[[Name]]`. Tension links get the marker: `- [[Name]] #contradiction — {what disagrees}`.
2. Apply the confirmed block through the bundled writer:

```bash
python3 "<mnemo-root>/scripts/vault-write.py" <<'JSON'
{"action":"insert","vault":"{vault}","note":"{target note}","anchor":"{unique anchor copied from safe-read}","position":"after","content":"{one JSON-escaped Markdown block containing only confirmed contextual links}"}
JSON
```

3. If a mapped hub suggestion was confirmed, repeat the same exact-anchor insert for the note reached through `taxonomy_roles.moc`.
4. Verify with the helper's `backlinks` action.

If an anchor is missing/non-unique or a concurrent edit wins, re-read and retry only the confirmed changes. A dynamic name or explanation can contain quotes, backticks, or `$()`; keep it JSON data and never use inline Obsidian CLI content.

## Advanced modes (optional)

- **Radius-2 (Scrapbox/Cosense-style):** two notes sharing ≥2 of the target's links are likely related even without shared text. If text search yields <3 results or user asks `--deep`, run:

```bash
python3 "<mnemo-root>/scripts/safe-read.py" shared-targets <<'JSON'
{"note_path":"{note_path}","vault":"{vault}"}
JSON
```

- **KJ-Canvas (bottom-up hub, 川喜田 affinity):** for `--canvas {topic}` — gather notes mapped to the `fact` role, drop them onto an Obsidian Canvas without categories, and let the user group spatially so structure emerges. Then name clusters → new `insight` notes / mapped-hub revision. In the default taxonomy those are Atoms, Molecules, and a MOC.

## Gotchas

Common failures in `<mnemo-root>/references/gotchas.md`. Tool-routing rationale in `<mnemo-root>/references/tool-routing.md`. Skill-specific rules:

- **Max 5-7 suggestions** — don't overwhelm. If you find more, rank and present top-7.
- **Don't suggest links to orphan notes** — they need their own fixing first (run `/mn:health` if interested).
- **Ghost notes are normal** — `[[Technology]]` pointing to a non-existent note enables entity discovery. Not "unresolved" in the bad sense.
- **Avoid generic connections** — "both mention Claude" is noise. A connection is meaningful if it shares a concept, approach, or unresolved question.
- **Never auto-apply** — always ask the user before writing new wikilinks.
