# Testing — mnemo smoke tests (current: v0.14.0)

Manual smoke tests for mnemo (the project has no automated test suite — these are the regression harness). Run after `/plugin update mnemo@mnemo` or `codex plugin install mnemo@mnemo`. Two layers below: the **6 per-skill checks** (version-agnostic — do the skills still behave) and the **"What changed in vX" feature checks** (grouped by the release that introduced each behavior — run the ones relevant to what you updated through).

## Status

- **Last full per-skill pass:** v0.7.3 — 7/7 clean on 2026-04-24 (large opus-4-7[1m] session; universal red flag never fired; two claude-mem v12.3.9 API bugs found in Check #4, patched in v0.7.4).
- **Feature checks v0.10–v0.14** added 2026-06-21 (this is the checklist; not yet run end-to-end on a fresh install). The v0.14.0 write-path check (V3) is the highest priority — it is the first frontmatter write `/mn:health` can make.

## What changed in v0.7.3

Model routing was rewritten to prevent mid-session model switches from triggering `API Error: Extra usage is required for 1M context` on Max plans. Four skills now run in isolated forked subagents (`context: fork` + `haiku` or `sonnet`); the remaining four inherit the session model (`model: inherit`). See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md#073---2026-04-24).

## What changed in v0.7.4

`/mn:save`'s claude-mem POST body switched from `content` → `text` to match v12.3.9 (previously returned `{"error": "text is required"}`). Key provenance (note name, vault, CM version) is now embedded in the `text` itself because v12.3.9 silently drops custom `metadata.*` fields — full-text search keeps the link back to Obsidian until upstream restores persistence.

## What changed in v0.10–v0.13 — smoke checks

Feature checks for the releases between v0.9 and v0.14. Run after `/plugin update mnemo@mnemo`.

- **A1 — Autodream-aware memory index (v0.10).** `/mn:health` Step 10: on a project whose `memory/MEMORY.md` exceeds `memory.indexWarnKB` (default 22), the report warns to run autodream (the index hard-truncates ~24.4 KB on load). Verify the threshold is read from config — set `memory.indexWarnKB: 5` on a small index → the warning fires earlier.
- **A2 — Type-aware review candidates (v0.11).** `/mn:health` Step 7: a stale `atom` is flagged against the **atom** budget (60d), not a flat 30; a note whose `reviewed:` is newer than its `date:` is **not** flagged (snooze); a note with per-note `ttl: 14` ages on 14 days regardless of type. With no `review` config → falls back to a uniform 30 days.
- **A3 — Content lint (v0.11, opt-in).** With `review.lint.enabled: true`, `/mn:health` Step 7.5 re-reads the top candidates and emits still-valid / update-needed / contradicts verdicts on `review.lint.model`. With it `false` (default) → the step is skipped silently.
- **A4 — Recency-aware recall (v0.12).** `/mn:ask` annotates each cited source with `changed YYYY-MM-DD` (git last-commit if the vault is a repo, else file mtime) and ⚠️-flags any cited note older than its type budget. "changed today" must NOT clear a stale flag — touch ≠ fresh (staleness uses `date`/`reviewed`).
- **A5 — Code-grounding (v0.13).** Run `/mn:ask` about *current state* ("is X still true / what changed") from **inside a git project** (CWD a repo, separate from the vault): it cross-checks the project's recent commits and flags a cited note a newer commit may have outdated. A pure "why did we decide" recall must NOT trigger it. `recall.codeGraph` stays off unless a backend is configured.

## What changed in v0.14.0 — smoke checks for the new behaviors

Three opt-in features were added (see [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md#0140---2026-06-21)). Run these after `/plugin update mnemo@mnemo`. The **stamp check (V3) is the highest priority** — it is the first and only frontmatter write `/mn:health` can make, and it had no automated coverage.

- **V1 — Compounding loop (`/mn:ask`).** Ask a question whose answer synthesizes ≥2 notes. Expect Step 6 to *offer* "save this synthesis as a Molecule" (not auto-save). Accept → confirm one `Molecule — …` note is created via `/mn:save` with a `cites:` frontmatter field and the source `[[links]]` pre-populated. Ask a question with **one** hit or **no** hits → the offer must NOT appear (Molecule-bar gate).
- **V2 — Research-gap candidates (`/mn:health`).** On a vault with a tag used ≥5 times and no matching `MOC — {Topic}`, the report shows a `🌱 Research-gap candidates` block suggesting the MOC. On a vault where every populous tag already has a MOC → block is omitted (no false suggestion). Never auto-creates anything.
- **V3 — autoStampReviewed write-path (`/mn:health`, the one write).** Set `review.lint.enabled: true` in `~/.mnemo/config.json` (default leaves it off — verify that with the flag off, health writes **zero** frontmatter). With lint on and `autoStampReviewed: true` (default), run `/mn:health` on a vault holding a stale-but-still-valid note. **Read the note back** and assert: `reviewed:` was added/updated to today's date, inside the `---` frontmatter block, with the note body unchanged. Then set `autoStampReviewed: false`, re-run, and assert the report only *recommends* the stamp and the file is **not** modified. Red flag: any write to a note the lint judged `update-needed`/`contradicts`, or any body-text change — health must only ever touch the `reviewed:` field of a still-valid note.

**Universal red flag for every test below:** if you see `API Error: Extra usage is required for 1M context` during any skill invocation, the routing regressed — a skill is still forcing a model switch in the main session. File an issue with the skill name.



## Prerequisites

- **Obsidian running**, vault `main` (or whatever is in `~/.mnemo/config.json`)
- **Plugin updated to v0.14.0** in the current session:
  ```
  /plugin update mnemo
  ```
  Verify:
  ```bash
  ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/mnemo/mnemo/ ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-mnemo/mnemo/ 2>/dev/null
  # expected: 0.14.0 (older version dirs can be deleted once confirmed working). Source of truth: ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
  ```
- **claude-mem plugin optional**. If `cascade.claude_mem.enabled=false`, `/mn:health` Step 0 and `/mn:save` claude-mem POST should skip silently.

## Test plan — 6 checks, ~10 minutes total

### 1. `/mn:health` — the biggest surface

```
/mn:health
```

**Expect:**
- **Step 0 respects claude-mem config** — if `cascade.claude_mem.enabled=false`, it skips silently; if enabled, it surfaces version/stale-cache state.
- **Steps 1-4 execute in parallel** (you'll see 4 Bash tool calls in a single assistant message).
- **Step 5 is instant** (~50ms) — uses `grep -rL` against vault filesystem, not per-file `obsidian read`.
- Final report shows: vault size, note counts by type, orphans, missing `## Связи`, stale notes, top hubs.

**Red flags:**
- Step 5 takes >5 seconds → `get-vault-path.sh` failed or vault filesystem scan is slow
- "claude-mem" section missing even though the plugin is installed → `check-cm-version.sh` path resolution broken
- References to "Obsidian must be open" gotcha inline in the skill body → reference files didn't extract (shouldn't happen since linter passed, but verify)

### 2. `/mn:ask` — pushy description triggers

Try a recall-style query you know is in your vault:

```
/mn:ask "что мы решили про tiered models в mnemo"
```

**Expect:**
- Skill triggers (pushy description changes in v0.7.1 should make this reliable).
- Step 3 fires **multiple `obsidian search` calls in parallel** (one message, many tools).
- Step 4 reads up to 7 notes **in parallel**.
- Answer cites specific notes with source labels like `[Source: Session — X]`.

**Red flag:** skill runs searches sequentially (one at a time) → parallelism rule didn't land.

### 3. `/mn:connect` — single-grep performance

```
/mn:connect "Atom — mnemo ask стоит расширить knowledge-agent для глобальных вопросов"
```

**Expect:**
- Step 3 runs **one `grep -rlE` with all concepts OR'd** against `$(obsidian vault vault="main" | awk '/^path/{print $2}')` — not N separate `obsidian search` calls.
- Backlinks check runs in parallel with grep (two tool calls, one message).
- Total time ~1-2 seconds for 7 concepts.
- Output: ranked list of 5-7 candidate notes with "why relevant" blurbs. Does NOT auto-apply.

**Red flag:** you see 7 separate `obsidian search` calls → single-grep fix didn't land.

### 4. `/mn:save` — claude-mem metadata enrichment

```
/mn:save "Тестовая заметка: smoke test mnemo. Facade ping."
```

**Expect:**
- Skill classifies the input (fact/insight/decision/gotcha).
- Creates Obsidian note via MCP (`mcp__obsidian__create`, not CLI).
- POSTs to claude-mem at `127.0.0.1:37777` using the `text` key (NOT `content` — v12.3.9 API requirement).
- `text` has a bracketed tail like `... [note: {name} | vault: main | cm: 12.3.9]` — provenance embedded because v12.3.9 silently drops `metadata.*` custom fields.
- `metadata: {...}` block is still sent (forward-compat for when upstream fixes drop-silent).
- Final report shows `Backends: Obsidian ✅, claude-mem ✅, memory/ ⏭` (or similar).

**Verify:** POST returns `{"success": true, "id": N}` — if it returns `{"error": "text is required..."}`, the `content` → `text` rename wasn't applied.

**Red flags:**
- `text` still labeled `content` in the skill body → v0.7.4 fix didn't land, POST will 400.
- `CM_VERSION` empty/missing → version detection broken; check `ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/thedotmack/claude-mem/`.

### 5. `/mn:review` — prewarmed caches + progressive disclosure

```
/mn:review
```

**Expect:**
- **First run of the session is near-instant** (~3s) because `plugins/mnemo/hooks/prewarm.sh` warmed `session-scan` + `skills-discover` caches on SessionStart.
- Session classified (Implementation / Research / Debugging / etc).
- Step 4 runs explicit `cat` on `triggers-{type}.md` + `triggers-universal.md` — you should see these file contents in the bash output.
- Skill gap analysis references the cat'd matrix, not an inline table in the skill body.

**Red flag:** no `cat triggers-*.md` call visible → Step 4 fix didn't land.

### 6. `/mn:setup` — idempotent handoff

```
/mn:setup
```

**Expect:** skill detects existing `~/.mnemo/config.json`, shows current values, asks whether to overwrite before rewriting. **Does NOT clobber** the existing `Meta — Session Handoff.md` — Step 6 checks and skips creation if it exists.

**Red flag:** handoff gets overwritten → idempotency fix didn't land.

## Codex smoke check

After installing through Codex:

```bash
python3 plugins/mnemo/scripts/session-scan.py
python3 plugins/mnemo/scripts/skills-discover.py | tail -5
```

Expected: both commands exit 0. `session-scan.py` should find the current Codex rollout JSONL when run inside an active Codex session, or print a graceful fallback if none exists.

## CI verification (Optional — in browser)

Open <https://github.com/jojoprison/mnemo/actions>. Last run should show **Skill lint passed** on `plugins/**` files. No workflow should be red.

## If something breaks

1. Note **which skill** and **what output differed** from "Expect" above.
2. Check cache: `ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/mnemo/mnemo/ ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-mnemo/mnemo/ 2>/dev/null` — if only an old version is there, the update didn't take effect. Try `/plugin update mnemo@mnemo` again or restart Claude Code.
3. Check CI: if GitHub Actions is red, the linter found an issue.
4. Open a fresh session with the same failure, tag Claude: "smoke test failed on `/mn:X`, expected Y, got Z" — we'll debug from there.

## Cleanup after a clean run

- Optionally delete the "Facade ping" test atom via Obsidian
- Remove legacy cache (older version dirs), only after confirming the current version works — and **never** a dir with a live `.in_use/` lock (check `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../<ver>/.in_use/` against running sessions first):
  ```bash
  ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/mnemo/mnemo/   # delete only stale, unlocked version dirs
  ```

## Expected total time

~10 minutes on a warm vault. All 6 checks independent — you can skip any that aren't relevant, but `/mn:health` and `/mn:ask` are the most important (cover the most surface).
